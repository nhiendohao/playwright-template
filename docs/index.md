[![Playwright Tests](https://github.com/nhiendohao/playwright-template/actions/workflows/playwright.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nhiendohao/playwright-template/actions/workflows/playwright.yml)

This is an template Playwright project. I implemented this framework for sharing playwright experiences from basic to advances.
## Main topics
- Introduce basic use cases with Playwright [here](https://github.com/nhiendohao/playwright-template/blob/master/tests/web/basic/demo-web-common.spec.ts)
- Introduce advance framework design with:
    - [Page Object Repo & Page Factory](https://github.com/nhiendohao/playwright-template/tree/master/tests/web/advance/PageObjectModel)
    - [ScreenPlay](https://github.com/nhiendohao/playwright-template/tree/master/tests/web/advance/ScreenPlay)
- Custom Reporter:
    - Allure Report
    - TestRail Repoter
